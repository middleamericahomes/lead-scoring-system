Phase 1: Project Foundation & Requirements
Stakeholder Alignment & Goals

Gather all stakeholders (e.g., business owners, developers, data analysts).
Finalize the core objectives:
Immediate focus on lead scoring MVP (minimum viable product).
Long-term vision for advanced data integrations, direct mail automation, etc.
Technical Requirements & Constraints

Determine hosting (on-prem vs. cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP).
Decide on a database solution (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
Set performance requirements (how quickly scoring must update, maximum data volumes).
High-Level Architecture

Identify the tech stack:
Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js
Frontend: React/Next.js
Database: PostgreSQL (highly recommended for complex queries & indexing)
Caching: Redis for speed
Outline integrations needed (eventually for court records, USPS API, direct mail platforms, etc.).
Team & Resource Allocation

Identify key roles: Lead developer, data engineer, front-end dev, QA/tester, etc.
Confirm budgets, timeline estimates, and essential developer skill sets needed.
Phase 2: Database & Data Model Design
Schema Definition

Create your core database schema for leads, tags, scoring rules, etc.:
properties table: property address, unique ID, owner info placeholder.
tags table: tag ID, name, expiration rules, scoring weight, date added, date expired.
lead_scores or integrated into properties: store updated scores, timestamp.
Ensure indexing on frequently queried columns (property address, owner name, scoring, tags).
Minimal Viable Data Fields

Decide which data points are must-have for the MVP:
Property Address (string)
Owner Name (string)
Mailing Address (string)
Basic set of tags (foreclosure, vacant, etc.)
Score (integer/float)
Additional fields (like phone, email, advanced distress info) can come later.
Data Import Mechanism (Initial Version)

Simple CSV/XLS importer or an API endpoint that ingests data.
Validate minimal fields on import (property address, at least one tag or score).
Store new records in the DB with a default or initial score if no tags.
Phase 3: Core Lead Scoring Engine (MVP)
Define Scoring Rules & Tag Weights

Document initial scoring logic. For example:
Foreclosure: +1500 points
Vacant: +2000 points
Probate: +1000 points
Determine how tags interact (e.g., if multiple tags, do they sum or do certain tags override others?).
Implement Automated Score Calculation

Upon data import or tag addition, recalculate score:
Sum all relevant tag weights, apply any date-based decay/expiration.
Store the computed score in the property record.
On-Demand & Scheduled Score Refresh

Daily Batch Job: re-check all properties and tags, update scores.
Manual Recalculate Button: in admin UI with a visible progress bar tracking real-time updates.
Basic UI/UX for MVP

Simple dashboard:
List of properties with scores & tags
Ability to filter by min score, tag type
A property detail page: see property info, assigned tags, current score.
Progress/Status page for bulk actions (score recalculation, data import).
Initial Testing & QA

Use a small dataset to ensure correctness of scoring logic.
Validate time it takes to process a few thousand or hundred thousand records.
Confirm data integrity (no duplicate property issues, correct scoring aggregates).
Phase 4: Early Adopter Feedback & Iteration
Pilot Launch

Bring in a small group of early adopters to test the system with real data.
Gather feedback on performance, UI usability, and scoring accuracy.
Performance Tuning

Optimize queries, add indexes as needed.
Scale up or adjust resources to ensure the daily scoring job can handle real volumes.
Improve caching strategy (e.g., Redis) if query response times are slow.
Enhance Scoring Logic

Adjust tag weights, or add new tags based on user feedback.
Implement or refine decay (aging) logic for older tags if required.
Start preparing for advanced tags (absentee classification, bankruptcies, etc.) in the next phases.
Phase 5: Address, Absentee, & Tagging Enhancements
Absentee Classification

Compare property address vs. mailing address.
Auto-assign tags (Owner-Occupied, Absentee In-State, Absentee Out-of-State).
Store absentee type and reflect in scoring logic (e.g., absentee might add +500 points).
Tag Expiration & Lifecycle

Implement automatic renaming to Expired - <Tag> after a set duration.
Modify scoring logic to reduce or remove points once a tag expires.
Do Not Append Mailing Address

Implement the DNAMA toggle for verified addresses.
Bulk toggling ability in UI or via CSV import for advanced users.
Phase 6: Advanced Integrations & Data Feeds
Court Record & Public Data Integration (Basic)

Start hooking into public data sources (APIs, web scraping) for:
Foreclosure updates
Probate filings
Tax liens
On a daily/weekly schedule, pull new data, update existing records or create new ones.
Deal with Large Volumes

Use background workers (Celery for Python or Bull for Node) for big data imports.
Allow user to see a progress bar & results log (successes, failures) in real time.
Direct Mail Campaign Triggering (Basic)

Start with a webhook or simple integration to a mail provider (e.g., Lob).
Each property's highest-scoring tag can trigger a direct mail template assignment.
Track mailed records in a dedicated table/log for compliance and follow-ups.
Phase 7: Comprehensive Deal Tracking & Analytics
Deal Tracking Module

Add new deals or transactions table capturing:
Lead source, contract date, offer date(s), closure date, profit/loss, reason lost, etc.
Link each deal to the relevant property & lead record.
Deal Analysis Dashboard

Summaries:
Total Deals
Total Profit
Average Acquisition Cost
Time to Close
Deal Sources (Which lists or tags led to closed deals)
Scoring Optimization

Track which tags & data points are common among successful vs. failed deals.
Weight future leads accordingly, gradually improving the scoring model.
Machine Learning: eventually predict lead success probability by analyzing historical data.
Phase 8: Full Region Autoload & Advanced Performance
Region Autoload

Implement bulk region import from official records, e.g., entire county or multiple counties.
Automate weekly or monthly refresh from that region's data source.
Auto-generate all properties, owners, addresses, mailing addresses in the region, with up-to-date info.
Scalability Testing

Simulate large-scale loads (millions of records).
Optimize any slow queries, leverage partitioning or advanced indexing strategies in PostgreSQL.
Confirm memory and storage scaling.
Advanced Features & Customization

Enhanced geospatial queries (e.g., find leads within a radius of a certain point).
More sophisticated analytics (time to lead conversion, cost per lead, etc.).
Phase 9: Final Polishing, UI Overhaul & User Experience
UI/UX Refinements

Improve Smart Lists filtering and sorting for speed and usability.
Enhance dashboards with charts (e.g., bar charts, time-series, pie charts for tag distribution).
Ensure mobile responsiveness if needed.
User Permissions & Security

Fine-tune role-based access controls (Admin, Manager, VA, etc.).
Implement robust auditing and logging for compliance.
Extensive QA & Beta Testing

Wider testing across different user groups or companies.
Gather and implement final feedback: usability, performance, reliability.
Phase 10: Full Launch & Continuous Improvement
Soft Launch

Migrate existing users/data to the production environment.
Monitor system usage (performance dashboards, error logs).
Provide detailed user training & documentation.
Continuous Feedback & Updates

Maintain an agile backlog of new requests and improvements.
Schedule monthly/quarterly releases for new features or enhancements.
Ongoing Optimization

Add new data integrations (child support, credit score data, etc.).
Explore deeper machine learning or AI modules.
Fine-tune marketing automations (SMS, ringless voicemail, etc.).
In Summary
Lay the Foundation: Clarify requirements, design the database, and finalize the architecture.
MVP Lead Scoring: Implement the simplest form of scoring and quickly iterate with real user feedback.
Enhance Features Gradually: Add absentee logic, advanced tags, court records, and direct mail automation.
Track Deals & Optimize Scoring: Pull all data from successful/failed deals to self-improve the scoring system.
Scale & Region Autoload: Automate large-scale imports, ensuring the system remains fast and stable under high volumes.
Polish & Launch: Finalize the UI, test thoroughly, launch, and continuously improve with new data sources and AI-driven insights.
Following this phase-by-phase strategy ensures you stand up a reliable, scalable lead scoring system quickly, then expand it methodically without losing focus or performance along the way.
