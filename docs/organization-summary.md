# Project Organization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the organization work completed for the Lead Scoring System project. The goal was to create a clean, logical directory structure that follows modern best practices for full-stack web applications.

## Organization Steps Completed

1. **Created Base Directory Structure**
   - Set up Next.js app router structure in `src/app/`
   - Created organized component directories in `src/components/`
   - Set up configuration, documentation, and deployment directories

2. **Organized Frontend Code**
   - Separated components by feature (leads, tags, layout, UI)
   - Moved page components to appropriate app router directories
   - Properly organized utility functions

3. **Organized Configuration Files**
   - Moved all configuration files to `config/` directory
   - Created subdirectories for different types of configurations (nginx, etc.)

4. **Organized Deployment Files**
   - Moved all deployment-related files to `deployment/` directory
   - Organized Docker files and environment configurations

5. **Organized Documentation**
   - Created a structured documentation hierarchy in `docs/`
   - Separated documentation by domain (deployment, frontend, backend, etc.)

6. **Organized Scripts**
   - Collected all utility scripts in `scripts/` directory
   - Created a cleanup script to handle temporary files

7. **Cleaned Up Temporary Files**
   - Removed duplicate files that were moved to appropriate locations
   - Removed macOS metadata files that can cause issues in containerized environments

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Intuitive organization by feature and function
   - Easier to find and navigate files

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Standardized structure following industry best practices
   - Reduced clutter in the root directory
   - Logical grouping of related files

3. **Enhanced Scalability**
   - Structure supports future growth of the application
   - Modular organization makes adding new features easier
   - Clear boundaries between different parts of the system

4. **Better Documentation Access**
   - Organized documentation by domain
   - Easy to find relevant documentation for specific tasks
   - Path to documentation included in main README

## Next Steps

1. **Review and finalize the organization**
   - Ensure all files are in their correct locations
   - Check for any remaining inconsistencies

2. **Commit the changes to the repository**
   - Create a clear commit message explaining the reorganization
   - Push changes to the main branch

3. **Update deployment processes**
   - Ensure deployment scripts reference the correct file paths
   - Test deployment to verify everything works correctly

4. **Share with team**
   - Communicate the new structure to team members
   - Provide guidance on where to find and place files going forward
